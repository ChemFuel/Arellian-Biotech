		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was a trooper of the Imperial Army. [PAWN_pronoun] fought in the thick of battle, trusted [PAWN_possessive] orders, and swung [PAWN_possessive] rifle like a hammer of imperial will. [PAWN_nameDef] never aimed for glory, just for anything that moved on the wrong side of the battlefield.</description>

		<description>From dust-choked fields to ruined cities, [PAWN_nameDef] stood firm and pulled [PAWN_possessive] weight. Orders came down, and [PAWN_pronoun] made sure they were followed — no questions, no complaints.</description>

		<defName>CFAR_ArmySoldier4</defName>
		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] learned quickly that in the Imperial Army, the safest place was behind [PAWN_possessive] gun. Following orders and dodging bullets, [PAWN_nameDef] did what infantry does best — survive, barely.</description>

	<BackstoryDef ParentName="CFAR_ArmySoldier">
		<defName>CFAR_ArmySoldier5</defName>
		<description>Bullets flew, grenades exploded, and [PAWN_nameDef] somehow survived it all with a rifle in one hand and a foul mouth. [PAWN_pronoun] wasn't a hero — just another soldier seeking fortune, honor, and glory.</description>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] kept the Imperial Army running, one hot meal at a time. [PAWN_pronoun] wasn’t much of a shot, but [PAWN_pronoun] was famous for bonking knuckleheads with [PAWN_possessive] ladle.</description>
