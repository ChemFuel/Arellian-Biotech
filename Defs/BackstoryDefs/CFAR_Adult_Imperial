		<title>Infantry</title>
		<titleShort>Infantry</titleShort>
		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] survived [PAWN_possessive] first deployment when an artillery barrage buried the trench and the squad dug out by hand. [PAWN_pronoun] doesn’t talk much now — just watches the skies and checks cover twice.</description>

		<defName>CFAR_Infantry2</defName>
		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] misunderstood “suppressive fire” as “nonstop fire” for weeks. It somehow worked. [PAWN_pronoun] has since become the squad’s go-to for chaotic breakthroughs. The Imperial Army calls it aggression; [PAWN_pronoun] calls it habit.</description>

	<BackstoryDef ParentName="CFAR_Infantry">
		<defName>CFAR_Infantry3</defName>
		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] once tripped over a power cable mid-charge and discharged [PAWN_possessive] pulse carbine into the sky. It scared off a recon drone. Since then, [PAWN_pronoun] acts like it was planned. The squad lets it slide.</description>
	</BackstoryDef>

	<BackstoryDef ParentName="CFAR_Infantry">
		<defName>CFAR_Infantry4</defName>
		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] learned to calibrate [PAWN_possessive] pulse rifle by trial, error, and a misfire into a sergeant’s locker. Shoots well now, even under pressure. Keeps quiet, keeps sharp, keeps the weapon clean.</description>
	</BackstoryDef>

	<BackstoryDef ParentName="CFAR_Infantry">
		<defName>CFAR_Infantry5</defName>
		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] made the mistake of insulting the cook sergeant’s seasoning once. Got triple-spiced stew for a week. Since then, [PAWN_pronoun] eats in silence and never complains — just sweats.</description>

	<BackstoryDef ParentName="CFAR_Infantry">
		<defName>CFAR_Infantry6</defName>
		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] argued daily with the squad tech over pulse calibration settings — until [PAWN_possessive] rifle overheated mid-firefight. Since then, [PAWN_pronoun] cleans the coils religiously and grumbles only half as much.</description>

	<BackstoryDef ParentName="CFAR_Infantry">
		<defName>CFAR_Infantry7</defName>
		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] nearly came to blows with a bunkmate over swapped rifle parts. The sergeant settled it by making both clean every weapon in the squad. [PAWN_pronoun] never mixes up rifles now — or shares tools.</description>
	</BackstoryDef>

	<BackstoryDef ParentName="CFAR_Infantry">
		<defName>CFAR_Infantry8</defName>
		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] doesn’t say much, but everyone in the squad listens when [PAWN_pronoun] speaks. [PAWN_pronoun] remembers names, shares rations, and knows who’s short a charge pack. Trust isn’t shouted — it’s built.</description>

	<BackstoryDef ParentName="CFAR_Infantry">
		<defName>CFAR_Infantry9</defName>
		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] slipped on a trench ladder and landed boots-first on a charging megaspider. It fled. The squad called it “tactical stomping” for weeks. [PAWN_pronoun] never confirmed or denied it.</description>

	<BackstoryDef ParentName="CFAR_Infantry">
		<defName>CFAR_Infantry10</defName>
		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] tripped during a sprint and skidded into a spelopede nest, [PAWN_possessive] rifle firing wildly. One hit. The rest fled. [PAWN_pronoun] calls it reflex; command called it lucky. Either way, [PAWN_pronoun] lived.</description>

	<BackstoryDef ParentName="CFAR_Infantry">
		<defName>CFAR_Infantry11</defName>
		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] lost a week’s rations in a poker game — then won it back bluffing with a torn card set and a straight face. [PAWN_pronoun] still plays, but now keeps backup snacks.</description>
	</BackstoryDef>

	<BackstoryDef ParentName="CFAR_Infantry">
		<defName>CFAR_Infantry12</defName>
		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] perfected the art of moving just fast enough to avoid notice. [PAWN_pronoun] cleans [PAWN_possessive] rifle only when it starts to hum funny and volunteers last for everything. Somehow, [PAWN_pronoun] always ends up in the right place — and walks out alive.</description>

<!--======== Soldier - Cook ========-->

	<BackstoryDef Name="CFAR_ArmyCook" ParentName="CFAR_Adult">

		<title>Army cook</title>
		<titleShort>cook</titleShort>
		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] kept the Imperial Army running, one hot meal at a time. [PAWN_pronoun] wasn’t much of a shot, but [PAWN_pronoun] was famous for bonking knuckleheads with [PAWN_possessive] ladle.</description>

	<BackstoryDef ParentName="CFAR_ArmyCook">
		<defName>CFAR_ArmyCook2</defName>
		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] served meals with the same discipline others served bullets. [PAWN_pronoun] fed the Empire’s war machine one ladle at a time — and occasionally added extra spice to the officers' stew.</description>

		<title>Infantry sergeant</title>
		<titleShort>Sergeant</titleShort>
		<description>Sergeant [PAWN_nameDef] marched with the Imperial Army's finest. [PAWN_pronoun] didn’t shout, didn’t brag — [PAWN_pronoun] just made sure [PAWN_possessive] squad stayed alive long enough to stomp the enemy flat.</description>

		<defName>CFAR_NCOInfantry2</defName>
		<description>The front line was messy, but Sergeant [PAWN_nameDef] was messier. [PAWN_pronoun] fought with grit, barked orders like cannon fire, and dragged victories out of battlefields that should’ve been lost.</description>
